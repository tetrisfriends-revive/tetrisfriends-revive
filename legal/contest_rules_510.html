						<p>Tetris Online, Inc. (&quot;Sponsor&quot;) is offering this Promotion (&quot;Promotion&quot;).  Sponsor, The Tetris Company LLC, and their affiliates shall be referred to collectively as the &quot;Promotion Entities&quot;.</p>

							<li id="one">

Proof of eligibility may be required.</p>
							</li>

							<li id="two">
								<p>2. This Promotion consists of a &quot;Premium Mission Contest&quot; (also referred to herein as &quot;the Promotion&quot; and &quot;the Contest&quot;), as described fully in these Official Rules. The Promotion begins on <b>Monday, May 10, 2010 at 12:00</b> am Central Time (&quot;CT&quot;) and ends on <b>Sunday, May 16, 2010</b> at 11:30pm CT (&quot;Promotion Period&quot;).  Proof of entry submission or participation in the Contest will not be deemed proof of receipt of such entry by Sponsor or proof of participation in Contest unless independently verified by Sponsor.  Participants in this Promotion are subject to, and must comply with, this Promotion&rsquo;s Official Rules, and the instructions on the Promotion&rsquo;s Web site and all terms of use and policies of the Sponsor. Please read all such rules, terms of use, instructions and policies carefully before participating in the Promotion.</p> 
							</li>

							<li id="three">
								<p>3. Two (2) ways to enter:</p>
								<p>(a) <b>Premium Mission Purchase</b>: You may enter the Promotion by purchasing a Premium Mission through the tetrisfriends.com website.  Each purchase of a Premium Mission will give you one entry to the random drawing for the Contest.  You may purchase as many premium missions (each a &quot;Mission&quot;) as you wish during the Promotion Period.  If you complete a Mission during the Promotion Period, you will receive one bonus entry into the random drawing for the Contest.  Note, the completed Mission must have been purchased and completed during the Promotion Period.  Any Premium Mission purchased prior to the Promotion Period will not qualify. If you collected all twenty (20) Premium Mission badges offered by Sponsor before the Promotion Period and therefore cannot purchase a Premium Mission during the Promotion Period, you may enter by emailing Sponsor (<a href="mailto:support@tetrisonline.com?subject=Premium%20Mission%20Contest%20%23510">support@tetrisonline.com</a>) from your registered user email address during the Promotion Period.  In your email, please specify that you are requesting an entry into &quot;Premium Mission Contest #510&quot; because you collected all twenty Premium Mission badges.  Only one such entry by email may be made by an eligible registered user.</p> 
								<p>(b) <b>Alternative method of entry</b>: You may enter the random drawing by hand&ndash;printing, on an approximately 3x5 card or piece of paper, your first name, last name, home address (no P.O. Box numbers), apt./suite, city, state/province/territory, zip/postal code, country, email address, home phone number, and mobile phone number (if applicable) and mailing your entry, in a #10 business sized envelope with proper postage affixed, to: <b>Tetris Online, Inc., ATTN: &quot;PREMIUM MISSION CONTEST #510&quot;, 55 Merchant Street, 17th Floor, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813, USA</b>.
