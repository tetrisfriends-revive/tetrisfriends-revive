								<h2>1. SCOPE OF THIS POLICY; CHANGES</h2>
								<a class="back_to_top hide_text" href="#top"><span>Top</span></a>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p>This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Tetris Online Inc. (&quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) with respect to your use of the TOA Products. </p>
								<p><strong>We may revise and update this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on this Policy the date it was last updated.  If the changes are significant, we also will notify you on the TOA Products that our Policy has been revised. We encourage you to review this Policy whenever you visit any of the TOA Products to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</strong></p>
								<p>This Policy applies to personal information collected through your interaction with or use of the TOA Products. This Policy does not apply to sites or applications operated by any third parties. In addition, this Policy is designed to apply to the TOA Products operated in offices within the United States and not any international affiliates or other companies or organizations to which we link.</p>
							</li>

							<li id="two">
								<h2>2. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
								<a class="back_to_top hide_text" href="#top"><span>Top</span></a>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p>We may collect various types of information about you, including personal, demographic and aggregate data.</p>
								<p>Demographic information is anonymous information, which may include your age, date of birth, gender, demographic area, hobbies or interests. Demographic information is not considered personal information unless it is linked with your other personal information, which we may do for a variety of reasons such as to customize the content according to your interests and preferences. Personal information does not include aggregate information, which is data we collect about the use of the TOA Products or categories of such users, from which personal information has been removed. Aggregate data is used for a number of purposes such as to help us understand trends and user needs so that we can improve our products and services.</p>
								<p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways through the TOA Products, such as when you voluntarily provide it in connection with registering, creating a profile, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or participating in the interactive games, forums or features of the TOA Products. If you leave a comment on a forum or provide a testimonial on the TOA Products, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit on or in the TOA Products.</p>
								<p>From time to time we may collect personal information that you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the TOA Products. If we collect information from you offline and it is linked with personal information, we will treat that information as personal information. Some personal information may also be automatically collected through the use of the TOA Products, as is described below (See Use of Cookies, IP Addresses and Web Beacons).</p>
								<p>When you use a TOA Product on your social network page or on someone else&rsquo;s page, we may record information regarding the use of that TOA Product, and we may collect other information that is visible on your social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.</p>
								<p>It is your responsibility to read and accept social networking sites&rsquo; Terms of Use, as well as their Privacy Policy prior to continuing to use such sites.</p>
								<p>When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the TOA Products, we collect and maintain the information associated with those messages, included email address and content.</p>								
							</li>

							<li id="three">
								<h2>3. USES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </h2>
								<a class="back_to_top hide_text" href="#top"><span>Top</span></a>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p>In general, we use personal information that we collect to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use and our administration and operation of the TOA Products, to learn more about and improve the TOA Products and for the purpose for which information was provided. For example, we may use the information we collect:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>i.</b> To send you a welcoming email or contact you about your use of the TOA Products, such as for administrative purposes or to provide you with customer service;</li>
									<li><b>ii.</b> To provide you with the services, products or information you request and to complete any transactions or facilitate the use of any features in connection there with, such as matching users for gameplay;</li>

This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, profile picture, the pictures of your social networking site &quot;friends,&quot; gender, and game scores. We may retain this information to enhance your experience when playing our games. For example we may post the high scores and profile pictures of you and your friends while you play one of our TOA Products. </p>
							</li>

							<li id="four">
								<h2>4. SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
								<a class="back_to_top hide_text" href="#top"><span>Top</span></a>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p>Tetris does not sell or rent personal information to third parties or share personal information with third parties outside the Tetris family of organizations, which currently includes The Tetris Company LLC (and its agent Blue Planet Software, Inc.) and Ace Studios, Inc. (collectively, the &quot;Tetris Family&quot;) except as described in this Policy as it may be revised from time to time, or with your consent. We may share your personal information with organizations that are part of the Tetris Family, which may use such information consistent with this Policy (see Use of Personal Information, above). We may also share personal information with consultants, vendors and service providers (&quot;Service Providers&quot;) who perform functions on our behalf, but we require that Service Providers only use such information as is necessary to carry out their work.  We also allow third party vendors to serve creatives and other ads on our sites to collect information about users' interactions with those ads. In addition, we may share your information with third parties if we have a good faith belief that the disclosure is necessary or appropriate to comply with law or legal process; to protect and defend the rights and property or personal safety of Tetris, our customers or the public; to prevent and protect Tetris and our users from fraudulent, abusive, unlawful or unauthorized use of the TOA Products; or to otherwise enforce our rights and agreements. We also may share such information with official law enforcement authorities in our sole discretion. Your personal information also may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of Tetris.</p>
							</li>

							<li id="five">
								<h2>5. ONLINE COMMUNITIES</h2>
								<a class="back_to_top hide_text" href="#top"><span>Top</span></a>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p>The TOA Products may include certain online communities and other interactive features, such as user profiles, user gameplay matching, blogs, forums, message boards and chat rooms. You should note that certain information you post or provide to such public areas of the TOA Products are publicly available and may be shared with other users. You can restrict user access to certain information through the privacy preferences setting on your account. However, although we strive to use commercially reasonable efforts to implement these privacy preferences, no system or security measure is perfect or impenetrable. In addition, when you use the TOA Products you are interacting with other users, not just your designated friends. You should always be cautious when giving out personal information to others in public online forums. We strongly encourage parents to supervise their children&rsquo;s activity in public forums and to caution them not to share any personal information.</p>
							</li>

							<li id="six">
								<h2>6. USE OF COOKIES, IP ADDRESSES AND WEB BEACONS</h2>
								<a class="back_to_top hide_text" href="#top"><span>Top</span></a>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p>When you visit the TOA Products, we automatically collect certain information, such as your computer&rsquo;s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer&rsquo;s operating system, the browser type, the address of the referring Web site, and your activity on the TOA Products. We may also collect certain information through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your hard drive and record your preference and other data about your visit to the TOA Products. </p>
								<p>If we combine cookies with or link them to any of the personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personally identifiable information; otherwise it is treated as and used in the aggregate. You may block, erase, or be warned of cookies through the browser settings on your computer; however, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, you may not be able to sign in or access TOA Products or certain features of TOA Products.</p>
 								<p>&quot;Web beacons&quot; (also known as &quot;Web bugs,&quot; &quot;action tags,&quot; &quot;pixel trackers,&quot; or &quot;clear GIFs&quot;) may also be used on the TOA Products or in emails relating to the TOA Products. Web beacons are small graphic images placed on a Web page or social network service application, Web-based document, or in an email message that allow the collection of certain information and monitor user activity on the TOA Products. Web beacons are invisible because of their size (only 1 by 1 pixel) and because they are the same color as the background of the Web page or application. Web beacons are used to collect non&ndash;personal information such as the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web user comes from and the time the Web beacon is activated (such as when you view the Web page, application, advertisement, or email that contains the Web beacon).</p>
								<p>We may also use one or more web analytics services. Web analytics services may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text you type on any TOA Product.  We may use the information collected through web analytics services to improve the user experience on TOA Products. </p>
							</li>

							<li id="seven">
								<h2>7. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING COMPANIES</h2>
								<a class="back_to_top hide_text" href="#top"><span>Top</span></a>
								<div class="clear"></div>
								<p>We may use or allow a third party advertising company or network to display ads on the TOA Products or in TOA Products. We may also use or allow a third party payment provider to collect information needed to facilitate payments and purchases on our site. Any information gathered by third parties is collected by such third parties, not Tetris. Such collection is handled by the third parties and therefore their privacy policies apply. For example, if you purchase goods or services from Tetris Online using the third party wallet provided by our payment processor or another vendor, including without limitation the Facebook credits program, your information may be stored by that third party for use with other participating sites or applications and would be subject to that processor&rsquo;s or vendor&rsquo;s privacy policy and practices. Currently, our third party wallet provider is Jambool. Their privacy policy can be found at: <a href="http://www.jambool.com/socialgold/privacy">http://www.jambool.com/socialgold/privacy</a> </p>
								<p>Third&ndash;party companies who serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit TOA Products may also use non&ndash;personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to TOA Products in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
