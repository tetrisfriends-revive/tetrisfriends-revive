								<p>TOA may offer a virtual, in&ndash;game currency (&quot;Virtual Currency&quot;) including, but not limited to coins, cash, or points, that may be purchased from TOA for &quot;real world&quot; money if you are a legal adult in your country of residence. TOA may also offer virtual, in&ndash;game digital items (&quot;Virtual Goods&quot;) that may be purchased from TOA for &quot;real world&quot; money or for Virtual Currency. Regardless of the terminology used, Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods may never be redeemed for &quot;real world&quot; money, goods or other items of monetary value from TOA or any other party.</p>
								<p>Other than a limited, personal, revocable, non&ndash;transferable, non&ndash;sublicenseable license to use the Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency on the applicable TOA Product for which such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency were acquired, you have no right or title in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency appearing or originating on any TOA Product, or any other attributes associated with use of any TOA Product, or offered or stored on or within any TOA Product.</p>
								<p>TOA has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods as it sees fit in its sole discretion, and TOA shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. TOA&rsquo;S RIGHTS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE RIGHT TO MANAGE, REGULATE, CONTROL, MODIFY AND/OR ELIMINATE VIRTUAL GOODS OR VIRTUAL CURRENCY OFFERED USING TERMS SUCH AS &quot;UNLIMITED&quot;, &quot;PERPETUAL&quot; OR &quot;ENDLESS.&quot;</p>
								<p>Transfers of Virtual Currencies and Virtual Goods are strictly prohibited except where explicitly authorized within the applicable TOA Product.  Outside of the applicable TOA Product, you may not buy or sell any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods for &quot;real world&quot; money or otherwise exchange items for value. Any attempt to do so is in violation of these Terms and may result in a lifetime ban from any or all TOA Products and possible legal action.</p>
								<p>You agree that all sales of Virtual Goods and Currencies are final. No refunds will be given, except in our sole and absolute discretion. All Virtual Goods and Currencies are forfeited if your account is terminated or suspended for any reason, in TOA&rsquo;s sole and absolute discretion, or if TOA discontinues providing the applicable TOA Product.</p>
								<p>If you have a balance of Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency unused for three years, TOA may redeem that balance by transferring some or all of such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency balance to users you have identified as friends or donating to a nonprofit organization of TOA&rsquo;s choice (and, if applicable, charging standard redemption fees for those transactions).</p>
								<p>If TOA elects to make Virtual Goods and/or Currencies available for purchase using credits offered by the applicable social networking site (&quot;SNS Credits&quot;), your purchase of SNS Credits is subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the social networking site from which the SNS Credits were purchased. It is your responsibility to read and accept those terms. TOA shall not be responsible or liable for your interactions with the social networking site or your purchase of SNS Credits.</p>
								<p>TOA will establish a redemption rate for SNS Credits that will be posted in the applicable TOA Product. This redemption rate may change from time to time, as determined by TOA in its sole discretion. TOA may stop accepting SNS Credits as a payment method for Virtual Goods or Currencies at any time.</p>
